#This project analyzes stock change over 4 quaters#

* This project aims to thoroughly examine the fluctuations in stock prices and trading volumes across multiple companies over the quaters 1, 2, 3, and 4. The main goal is to analyze large sets of data related to stock market performance during this period.

1. I've developed a script that systematically goes through these datasets, row by row, to identify patterns and extract insights about how individual stocks have performed.

2. My analysis focuses on several key metrics. I calculate the annual change in stock prices change of the initial value. Additionally, the script highlights significant trends, such as identifying the stock that experienced the highest percentage increase, indicating strong performance, as well as pinpointing the stock with the most significant decline in percentage terms.

3. Furthermore, I identify the stock with the highest trading volume. This metric can indicate either a high level of market activity or sustained market stability.
